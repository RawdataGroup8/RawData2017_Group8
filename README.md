A collaborative project containing the files relevant to the 2017 course RAWDATA at Roskilde University
by Kristoffer Schou, Eugenio Capuani, Kidane Mehari and Rune Barrett. 

Start guide if in doubt :)
- clone this repo to wherever you want the project/the working files/the repo
- add it to sourcetree (if using that) (add existing in sourcetree)
- use git pull before working (to avoid unlikely but unescessary conflicts(especially when working in collaborative files))
- commit (with a meaningful message) whenever you start on something 'new', take a long break, finish something etc. (Good git practice, makes things more structured and the history more usable) if in doubt, commit.
- push almost as often as committing for similar reasons

If you want some git entertainment this tutorial from Daniel Shiffman (One of the writers of Processing) is actually really good. Very lightweight but still super informative and compact.  :)
